/* 
    Firebase Notification 
    (When any user login, the front-end will generate token which saves in "deviceTokens Array"in DB.
    This token will then send in Firebase method in Node JS server which tells firebase to send notification to 
    that device which has this token. We created separate folder named as external services in 
    which Firebase has been created. Firebase service contains Firebase's methods.)
